# Conditional-Generative-Adversarial-Network
Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) are a class of generative models that extend the capabilities of traditional GANs. 

cGANs introduce conditional information, allowing the model to generate data samples conditioned on specific input data or labels. 
In the context of image generation, cGANs take a label or additional information as input and generate corresponding images. 

In this project, we explore the implementation and training of a cGAN for generating images. Here is an image which shows the architectural difference between GAN and cGAN.
